                    Nature is defined as our environment. It is the interaction between the physical world around us and
                    the life within it like the atmosphere, climate, natural resources, ecosystem, flora, fauna and
                    humans. Nature also includes non-living things such as water, mountains, landscape, plants, trees
                    and many other things. Nature adds life to mother earth. Nature is the treasure habitation of every
                    essential element that sustains life on this planet earth. Human life on Earth would have been dull
                    and meaningless without the amazing gifts of nature.
                    Nature is the only provider of everything that we need for survival. Nature provides us with food,
                    water, natural fuels, fibres, and medicinal plants. Nature regulates natural processes that include
                    decomposition, water purification, pollution, erosion, and flood control. It also provides
                    non-material benefits like improving the cultural development of humans like recreation, etc.

                <p><b class="fs-1">Earth</b>, our home planet, is a world unlike any other. The third planet from the sun, Earth is the only place in the known universe confirmed to host life.
                    With a radius of 3,959 miles, Earth is the fifth largest planet in our solar system, and it's the only one known for sure to have liquid water on its surface. Earth is also unique in terms of monikers. Every other solar system planet was named for a Greek or Roman deity,
                    but for at least a thousand years, some cultures have described our world using the Germanic word “earth,” which means simply “the ground.”</p>

                <p>Earth orbits the sun once every 365.25 days. Since our calendar years have only 365 days, we add an extra leap day every four years to account for the difference.
                    Though we can't feel it, Earth zooms through its orbit at an average velocity of 18.5 miles a second. During this circuit, our planet is an average of 93 million miles away from the sun, a distance that takes light about eight minutes to traverse.
                    Astronomers define this distance as one astronomical unit (AU), a measure that serves as a handy cosmic yardstick.
                    Earth rotates on its axis every 23.9 hours, defining day and night for surface dwellers. This axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees away from the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun, giving us seasons. Whichever hemisphere is tilted closer to the sun experiences summer, while the hemisphere tilted away gets winter. In the spring and fall, 
                    each hemisphere receives similar amounts of light. On two specific dates each year—called the equinoxes—both hemispheres get illuminated equally.</p>
